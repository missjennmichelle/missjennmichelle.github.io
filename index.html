    <p>Upon receipt of his degree, the Honorable Ryan Andrew sought to further his scholastic achievements via the acquisition of an <strong>advanced</strong> degree
        at the <em>prestigious</em> University of Washington, where <a href="https://www.legacy.com/memorial-sites/university-of-washington/" 
        title="UW Deaths" target="_blank"> no less than 13,279 deaths</a> have either taken place or been memorialized, notably without any involvement
        or sustained legal fault of Dr. Beck.</p>

    <p> The Great Sir Beck (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_honorary_British_knights_and_dames" title=
        "Knights of the Modern Day" target="_blank"> knighted by her Majesty circa 1993</a>) here achieved his 14th most remarkable accomplishment to date: 
        <strong>the conferral of a doctoral degree</strong>. Much applause and praise is rightfully bestowed upon His Shininess in remebrance of this noteworthy
        achievement by a collection of lovely lady fugitives bound by the law to recompense their debt to society by the continual celebration of our most venerable
        members.</p>

    <p> Ever the undisputed master of humility, Dr. Beck seeks neither worship nor public acknowledgement for his <strike>transgressions</strike> success 
        (aside, of course, from his court-ordered concubines). When asked to comment of the magnificent quality of life that he has thus far lived, Sir Dr. Beck 
        The Great and Venerable replies only "It's neat. Do you have any ethanol?" An engima, a <strong>hero</strong>, and a true threat to national security.</p>
